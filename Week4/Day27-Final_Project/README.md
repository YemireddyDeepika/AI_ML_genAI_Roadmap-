# Loan Approval Prediction – End-to-End ML Project

This project predicts whether a loan will be approved using
a complete machine learning workflow.

## Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing
- Feature scaling with Pipeline
- Cross-Validation
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Model comparison
- Confusion matrix evaluation

## Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Outcome
Selected the best performing model and used it to
predict loan approval for new applicants.
