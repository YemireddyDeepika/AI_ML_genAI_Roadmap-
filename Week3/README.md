# 📊 Week 3 – Machine Learning Algorithms & Mini Projects

This week focuses on **core Machine Learning algorithms**, their intuition, implementation using **scikit-learn**, evaluation, and real-world mini projects.  
By the end of this week, I gained hands-on experience with **classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction**, and **feature engineering**.
